# Calculator-Solution

Welcome to the Basic Calculator project! This is a beginner-friendly JavaScript program that performs simple arithmetic calculations. The calculator can add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers using a simple text-based interface.

## What Does This Project Do?

This calculator takes a mathematical expression as text (like "5 + 3") and gives you the result. It's designed to be simple and easy to understand, making it perfect for learning basic programming concepts.

## How It Works

The calculator works in several steps:

1. It takes an input string in the format "number operator number" (for example, "5 + 3")
2. It breaks this string into three parts: the first number, the operator, and the second number
3. It figures out which operation to perform based on the operator
4. It performs the calculation and shows you the result

## Features

The calculator can perform four basic operations:
- Addition (using +)
- Subtraction (using -)
- Multiplication (using *)
- Division (using /)

## How to Use the Calculator

1. First, make sure you have the calculator.js file in your project
2. Then, you can use the calculator by calling the `calculate()` function with your expression as a string
3. The expression should have spaces between the numbers and the operator

Here are some examples of how to use it:

```javascript
calculate("4 + 6");    // Shows: Result: 10
calculate("10 - 5");   // Shows: Result: 5
calculate("3 * 4");    // Shows: Result: 12
calculate("20 / 2");   // Shows: Result: 10
```

## Important Notes

- Use only the operators +, -, *, and /
- The calculator will show an error message if you use an invalid operator
- Numbers can be whole numbers or decimals

## Project Structure

The project consists of several functions:

1. `add(a, b)`: Adds two numbers together
2. `subtract(a, b)`: Subtracts the second number from the first
3. `multiply(a, b)`: Multiplies two numbers together
4. `divide(a, b)`: Divides the first number by the second
5. `calculate(inputString)`: The main function that processes your input and shows the result

## Common Errors and How to Fix Them

1. If you see "Error: Invalid operator", check that:
   - You're using one of these operators: +, -, *, /
   - You have spaces between the numbers and the operator

2. If you get unexpected results, make sure:
   - Your input is in the correct format ("number operator number")
   - You're using numbers that make sense for the operation

Remember: Programming is about learning through experimentation. Don't be afraid to try things and learn from what happens!
